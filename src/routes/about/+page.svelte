					<li>In One God, who has revealed Himself in Scripture through the Old and New Testaments as three Persons; Father, Son and Holy Spirit</li>
					<li>God is Creator and Sustainer of all seen and unseen. God is eternal, unchanging, all-knowing, and good. God is continually at work guiding His creation.</li>
					<li>In God the Father - who loves each of us with unconditional and eternal love.</li>
					<li>In Jesus - the Son of God, Word became flesh. Jesus is our Savior - He came to earth fully God and fully man - He suffered, died, was buried, and rose victorious over sin and death. Through Jesus and His perfect obedience to God, we are offered forgiveness and redemption.</li>
					<li>In the Holy Spirit - sent by the Father and Son to convict and renew. Counselor, teacher, comforter, helper, advocate - uniting us for the glory of God.</li>
					<li>That following Jesus Christ brings new life and we are empowered to live as we were created to as sons and daughters of God, accomplishing all for His glory.</li>
					<li>In the promises of God giving us a hope and future, both now and life everlasting â€“ Where someday every tribe, tongue, and nation will join together to worship God and enjoy Him forever!</li>

				<h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Founded in 1958</h3>
				<p class="mb-4">In February of 1957, Reverend Willis Ethridge and his wife, Mildred, left their home in Ontario, Canada. Their mission was to start the Christian Deaf Fellowship Center in Kingston, Jamaica. Upon arrival in Jamaica, they found a greater need than they had imagined, and felt the Lord calling them to open a school. They were soon joined by Paula Montgomery, the first Deaf American missionary.</p>
				<p>Together, the three missionaries were offered a one-year lease of a property in Manchester Parish, Jamaica, where they opened a school with eight students and a staff of three.</p>

Kingston is home to half the population of Jamaica, as well as many deaf who do not have access to the Knockpatrick and MoBay campuses. Today, the Kingston campus serves around 40 students and is home to the Deaf Can! Coffee enterprise.</p>

				<h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Jamaica Deaf Village</h3>
				<p class="mb-4">The three school campuses continued to run smoothly, and graduated class after class -- but the Deaf graduating from high school still struggled to find employment. Employers did not have the time or resources to devote to learning to communicate with the Deaf, and did not hire them.</p>
				<p class="mb-4">No job means no money, and no money means that, despite their education and potential, the deaf graduates were unable to provide for their own basic needs. Many turned to desperate means to obtain food, clothing, and shelter.</p>
				<p>And so in June of 1984, the CCCD ministry began development of the 100-acre Jamaica Deaf Village, which would serve as a safe place where Deaf adults and their families could live in community, attend worship, and find meaningful employment.</p>

				<h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Factory & Church</h3>
				<p class="mb-4">The Jamaica Deaf Village (JDV) campus continued to grow with the addition of a church, a woodworking factory, apartment complexes for the Deaf, and more -- none of which could have been constructed without the assistance of mission teams.</p>
				<p class="mb-4">Finally, in 2002, after many years of miracles mixed with trying circumstances, the first villagers moved onto campus, and the first steam-bent wooden rocking chair was manufactured in the factory.</p>
				<p>Shortly thereafter, the first church service was held at the village, led by Rev. Gary Williams, who plants Deaf churches within the hearing churches of Kingston. There were nearly 60 Deaf present that Sunday, and ever since, the Deaf have been worshipping, fellowshipping, and growing in Christ Jesus at JDV.</p>

			<p class="mb-4">We have the privilege of knowing, serving, and trusting in a God who loves us. Help us to spread the word of Jesus Christ to the Deaf in Jamaica. You can do this in many ways:</p>
			<ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
				<li>Keep us operating by giving to our General Fund</li>
				<li>Sponsor one of the children on our campuses</li>
				<li>Bring a team to visit and help us continue to build and grow our campuses</li>
				<li>Continue to spread the word of the work we're doing here in Jamaica</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We hope that, with your help, the mission of the CCCD can continue to expand and grow.</p>
